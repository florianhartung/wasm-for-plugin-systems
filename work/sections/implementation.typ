// == Rust
// #todo[Is a Rust section necessary?]
// - Short explaination of why Rust is used for this project:
// - Helix is written in Rust.
// - However this work is not about any technology in particular, and instead it will focus more on WebAssembly, which may be used from pretty much any language where a runtime exists.
// - Why does Helix use Rust?

= Proof of concept: Implementing a WebAssembly plugin system for a text editor (10 pages)
