= Introduction

== Motivation & problem statement
// Motivation
- Plugin systems are suitable architecture for highly individual software like text editors
- WASM is relativly modern bytecode that provides speed, safety, ... by default.

- Can WAS

#todo[write motivation last]

// Problem statement
- WASM's usecases are very limited -> it is still very new and evolving
- Plugin systems suffer from many issues: Security, interoperability, Portability, (Developer experience?)

== Research question
Is WebAssembly the best technology choice for designing versatile plugin systems specifically for text editors?

== Method (structure of this work)
- How will this work be structured?
- What technologies, languages and terms are used?
