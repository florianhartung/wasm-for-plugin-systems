  // Context, previous work
  Plugin systems are a software architecture pattern for making host applications extensible without modifying the host application itself.
  They are used in various applications such as real-time audio processing or computer games, but they play a particularly important role in text editors.
  Text editors and IDEs are applications used primarily by developers for software development.
  Depending on the required technologies and highly individual developer preferences, text editors must be able to adapt to a variety of different use cases.
  Such use cases may include language support, complex keybindings or development on a remote server.

  WebAssembly (Wasm) is a relatively new technology first released in March 2017.
  It was originally designed as a fast, safe and portable compilation target for higher level languages to enable fast code execution on the web.
  However, it is designed with no assumptions about its execution environment and its properties make it an interesting technology for non-web contexts such as avionics, distributed computing, embedded devices or automotive as well.
  
  // Problem statement, goal
  This work explores Wasm as a technology for implementing a safe and fast plugin system with portable plugins compiled from higher level languages, such as C, C++, Rust, Python or JavaScript.
  The question is whether Wasm, as a new and versatile technology, can outperform existing plugin system technologies in terms of performance, security, compatibility and ease of development.

  // Methods
  To do this, a technology comparison is conducted between selected existing plugin systems to analyze the state of the art of plugin system technologies.
  WebAssembly will then be evaluated against the same criteria to provide an objective comparison with existing technologies.
  Finally, as a proof of concept, a plugin system based on WebAssembly will be developed for an existing text editor project to provide a better insight into the current state of the rapidly evolving Wasm ecosystem.
